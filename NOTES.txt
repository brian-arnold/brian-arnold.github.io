If you want a page to also have a tab in the header of the website, add an entry to _data/navigation.yml and have the url match that of the permalink of the page you want it to go to.

To create pages in labeled subdirectories (as opposed to all pages in parent directory), just modify the 'permalink' variable in the YAML header to fix the URL for jekyll.

if you want to create a list of links to other pages within your website, create the data for these links (names on urls) in YAML format in the _data directory, and then loop through these using Liquid:

<ul>
{% for item in site.data.resources.resources_1 %}
    <li><a href="{{item.url}}" alt="{{item.title}}">{{item.title}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>


For pages with titles (e.g. About, Resources), do not start them with a markdown header, just regular text. For reasons I don't understand, starting a page with a header replaces the title name with the name of this header on the top of the page, duplicating it. I only observe this problem on the live website, not on the locally built one!
