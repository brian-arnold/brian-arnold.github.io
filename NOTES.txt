If you want a page to also have a tab in the header of the website, add an entry to _data/navigation.yml and have the url match that of the permalink of the page you want it to go to.

To create pages in labeled subdirectories (as opposed to all pages in parent directory), just modify the 'permalink' variable in the YAML header to fix the URL for jekyll.

if you want to create a list of links to other pages within your website, create the data for these links (names on urls) in YAML format in the _data directory, and then loop through these using Liquid:

<ul>
{% for item in site.data.resources.resources_1 %}
    <li><a href="{{item.url}}" alt="{{item.title}}">{{item.title}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>


For pages with titles (e.g. About, Resources), do not start them with a markdown header, just regular text. For reasons I don't understand, starting a page with a header replaces the title name with the name of this header on the top of the page, duplicating it. I only observe this problem on the live website, not on the locally built one!


# CHANGING THE LOGO, IN TABS BUT ALSO IN THE HEADER OF EACH PAGE
- design logo in powerpoint, see logo dir in root
- export logo as PDF from powerpoint
- crop PDF and export as PNG
- save this PNG but also convert it to an SVG file with color using this website: https://onlineconvertfree.com/convert-format/png-to-svg/
- Follow instructions specifically for TeXt theme: https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/docs/en/logo-and-favicon
- after following these instructions, you downloaded favicon_package_v0.16.zip and put it in the logo dir in root
- unzip this file, and put itâ€™s contents in the assets dir in root, which will overwrite some files, also put the favicon.ico file in root
- take the svg file you made in logo, and put this in _includes/svg, this will modify the picture in the header of each page!
