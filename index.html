Welcome to my personal website that is <b>beautifully devoid of advertisements</b>! An internet oasis!

<br>
<br>

I primarily use this site as a means to organize knowledge. This organized documention of info helps my memory, and I thought doing all of this publicly may be occasionally useful to others.

<br>
<br>

This site is currently in its early development and will continually be a work in progress.
