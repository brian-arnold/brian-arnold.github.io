# TO DO:
###
- why are headers being duplicated and replacing the headers I expect on internet, but not on local build!?
- add talks to CV
- add web design (with Jekyll, liquid, and HTML)  to skills (this website!)




WEBSITE CONTENT

Clearly separate sections that are self-promotional vs general information

- About
    - sections: CV (with page - aside), Data scientist with expertise in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology, career goals/reflections on academic staff scientists roles and how to keep up with new methods or be a generalist
    - explain why you like being a senior staff scientist: constant collaboration w/ people of all experience levels, still get to analyze data, most of the joy I’ve gotten out of science was collaborating with others and helping them with their projects?
    - Staff scientist role/philosophy, some tasks
        - help PIs get grants
            - particularly useful for junior faculty 
        - teach workshops
        - serve as consultants to grad students postdocs re. technical skills
        - collaborate: bringing fresh ideas to a project. Bioinformaticians, at intersection of CS, Stats, and Biology can:
            - collaborate with faculty in biology departments in helping to construct algos, scale methods, apply newest technologies with HPC
            - collaborate with CS departments that specialize in algorithms by applying their algos to large biological datasets
        - serve as an extra pair of (highly experienced) hands
            - some projects can take a considerable amount of time, potentially creating burnout for grad students and postdocs
            - help meet deadlines 
        - many of these tasks may be accomplished indirectly by a staff scientist helping to set up and organize infastructure/large datasets to make all downstream analyses easier, clearer, and more reproducible in the case that some analyses need to be repeaated

        - interview faculty about what supportive roles in the uni they think would benefit their labs? What are students/postdocs struggling with that they feel they have to figure out on their own? Being first author can be extraordinarily demanding, and putting a paper together primarily by yourself requires more time than anyone anticipates. How to speed this up or make process more enjoyable? bioinformatician/data scientist != sys admin, and these scientists should be constantly working with other computer scientists with specialized knowledge of HPC architecture. Nature/science have some good articles on the role of staff scientists.

- Resources (site serves as way to organize knowledge, and documenting it helps memory)
    - selected notes on R (with R: factors: levels and values and changing these so that colors are in order; see https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html)
    - selected notes on python ( sorting list of tuples by second element, sorting dictionary by values, etc.)
    - stats BS detector 
        - (https://elifesciences.org/articles/48175)
    - HPC notes (aliases)
    - How to make a binder, forking the repo here (https://github.com/binder-examples/r-conda) and changing the binder URL accordingly.
    - graphic design
        - color brewer
        - https://coolors.co/generate
        - Nat Methods articles

- Bioinformatics
    - I have experience processing numerous types of sequencing data, from various types of organisms that have dramatically different genomes, such as plants (including polyploids), mammals, and bacteria. (have link to papers showing examples)
    - How to keep up with new methods/approaches?
        - over then past 10 years as the number of people creating bioinformatic software has exploded, I’ve gone from mostly coding up my own analyses to primarily becoming an expert Googler, where I almost always find that someone has already done exactly what I needed. While I still need to create pipelines to string everything together (although that too may be replaced one day) I do miss the days when I had to more routinely think about algorithm construction. But, getting results much faster is also fun!
- Notes
    - curate important papers from diff fields to show ppl you’re a generalist, as opposed to having projects in each field? e.g. metagenomics you know some stuff now… but no project
    - i thoroughly enjoy helping students and postdocs of all experience levels with their computational analyses (it’s also my job), so I created this section as a way to reflect on what trainees may find useful (and writing this down will help me remember them!). 
    - As I analyze datasets, I try to reflect on the relevant topics that I had to learn in order to to them
    - bioinformatics is a broad field that can involves tons of programming languages and topics in computer science, statistics, systems administration etc… but there’s absolutely no need to be an expert in all of these fields. If you have deadlines, then just learn the minimum necessary to get the project done, and do some extra reading in the future if there’s time. I personally try to force time into my schedule against the will of my deadlines to make sure I keep learning (e.g. probability theory or statistics) or keep up with some subfield (e.g. bacterial genomics).
    - have programs listed that you use on a regular basis to look at files? e.g. csvkit…
    - have guide to probing troublesome jobs, e.g. tasks that occasionally take a long time to finish for no apparent reason? or hanging in I/O from slow/unresponsive file system?

    - globus
    - styling github pages with markdown syntax?
    - backing up files to cluster with scp/rsync!
    - have list of different kinda of analyses/methods you can use to analyze data? E.g. for bacteria you can distinguish between alignment-based and alignment free (e.g. kmer based network construction)
- logo ideas
    - chipSeq peaks?
    - matlab heatmap from epistasis paper?
    - dna pixel art?
    - bacteria+phage
    - something retro? computer?
    - some plant/animal made out of something machine-looking
        - succulent with circuit board pattern superimposed? or bacteria?

- Learning resources
    - Harvard Stats calsses, MIT open courses (computational thinking: languages change, tasks may involve using diff one, understanding comp think applies to many/all of them!)


Probing job:
	squeue to get name of the node a job is running on
	ssh into that node
	type “top”
		interpreting this output requires some work
	strace -p PID
