# Great textbooks for machine learning (ML)!

Like classical statistics, ML is a set of tools that are extremely useful to have at your disposal as you try to better understand your data. 

>[If the statistics field had] incorporated computing methodology from its inception as a fundamental tool, as opposed to simply a convenient way to apply our existing tools, many of the other data related fields [such as ML] would not have needed to exist -- they would have been part of statistics.
> -- Jerry Friedman, taken from "Probabalistic Machine Learning" by Kevin Murphy

For many of the textbooks linked below, free versions of PDFs are likely buried on the internet!

## My favorite ML textbook
 - [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)
    - not finished yet, but descriptions are wonderfully clear and concise
    - while an introduction, it has more math/linear algebra than textbooks listed below
    - has a follow up [book](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html) that covers advanced topics

## Introductory ML

- [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/)
    - note that predictions are not just about the future, but for any value you don't know
    - very applied, little to no math, great coverage of many topics (except not much detail on neural networks)
    - good discussions of the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy and interpretability
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
    - the first ML textbook I read!
- [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)
    - great, simple intro to neural networks
    - very practical, all code and *no math*
    - I found some terms/concepts weren't clearly defined (b/c no math) and neural nets are never visually described, which I find useful
    - If you're willing to google topics that you find insufficiently explained, this book is a great way to get started with neural networks and deep learning

## Less introductory ML

- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) 
    - drink from the firehose
    - a few sections on more advanced topics were a bit hard to follow, but overall many gems here, especially the section on Structured Probabilistic Models <3<3<3


## Not exactly ML but real important
- [Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/)
    - linear algebra is the language of ML, and Gilbert Strang is **the** person you should learn it from
