# Data Science

Although the topics below may seem like a lot, you **do not** need to be an expert in any of them in order to do research. A little familiarity with each topic will get you most (if not all) of the way there, so I try to only highlight the most important points.


- [Conda](/resources/datascience/conda)
    - essential for installing/managing software
- [Command-line interface](/resources/datascience/commandline)
    - essential for interacting with remote servers, e.g. Princeton's High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters
- [Python](/resources/datascience/python)
    - an easy-to-read, general-purpose programming language that can help you at *every* stage of your research, including data gathering, statistical modeling, and visualization!
    - most popular language in data science!

The following topics are not as essential as the ones above but I strongly recommend learning them:
- Visual Studio Code
    - code editor that makes life easier
- [Git and GitHub](/resources/datascience/github)
    - essential for version control (saved snapshots of your code) and collaboration
