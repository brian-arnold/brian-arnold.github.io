# Data Science

Although the topics below may seem like a lot, you **do not** need to be an expert in any of them in order to accomplish your research goals. A little familiarity with each topic will get you most (if not all) of the way there, so I try to only highlight the most important points.

- [Conda](/resources/datascience/conda)
    - essential for installing/managing software
- [Statistics for Biologists](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) by Nature Methods
    - Fantastic collection of ~40 two-page papers on important quantitative topics
- [Common statistical mistakes](/resources/datascience/statsBsDetector/)
