# Key concepts in Data Science

This page contains brief explanations of elementary but important concepts in Data Science. While these concepts are discussed many places, I like creating (or collecting from elsewhere) exceptionally simple, clear explanations with visualizations that can immensely help understanding. I try to keep these topics short and provide code so that you can verify everything yourself!


- [regression to the mean](/resources/datascience/regressionToMean/)
- model (over)fitting, training, and testing
