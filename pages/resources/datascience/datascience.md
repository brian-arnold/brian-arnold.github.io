# Key concepts in Data Science

This page contains brief explanations of elementary but important concepts in Data Science (statistical analysis and interpretation). While these concepts are discussed many places, explanations are not always clear, nor are the reasons why I should care. For pedagogical reasons and for my own memory, I like creating (or collecting from elsewhere) exceptionally simple, clear explanations with visualizations that can immensely help understanding. I try to keep these topics short and provide code so that you can verify everything yourself!
