# Python

While R is a powerful and popular language for data science in biology, Python is also extremely useful and has numerous packages that can be used for a large range of tasks. I personally find it's best to be familiar with both languages in order to use the best tool for the job, but to pick one of them to be your default language that you use for most tasks. For me, that's Python, but for others it may be R.

[Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/beginner-python/) is a fantastic introduction to learning python from Microsoft, which I particularly like because they also introduce you to VS code, which is a great IDE (integrated development environment) for python that has made life much easier for me.
