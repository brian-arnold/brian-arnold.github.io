As part of Princeton University's [DataX](https://csml.princeton.edu/news/videos-datax-data-scientists-discuss-their-role-and-impact-research) initiative, I am a biomedical data scientist in the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. 

In addition to teaching workshops on data science, I do research in the department of Computer Science with [Ben Raphael](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/) on topics in cancer genomics and collaborate with [Shane Campbell-Staton](https://www.campbellstaton.com/) in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

You can find a talk of my work on "Learning mixtures and DNA copy-numbers from bulk seuqencing of tumor samples" [here](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai/events/events-past#uoe_featurebox_e98a5cc58bf69187c764e7147d3f1d965:~:text=Brian%20Arnold%2C%20Senior%20Data%20Scientist%2C%20Princeton%20University.), and I was an invited guest on the *Nice Genes!* [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/nodding-our-tusks-to-heroic-mutations/id1622851335?i=1000574742314) for my work on tuskless African elephants.

# Career

I am a senior research scientist in academia. My exact role depends on funding sources and the community I work with but generally includes:

- **Collaborative research**
    - with computer scientists
        - run existing software on large datasets to identify issues and implement improvements
        - help build new software for data science
    - with biologists
        - take a lead role in analyzing data and publishing results
        - help students run existing software or develop custom analyses
        - construct automated workflows for reproducible results with large datasets
- **Building Infrastructure**
    - develop scalable computational workflows to accelerate research
    - adapt analyses to run in the cloud (GCP, AWS) 
- **Service**
    - teach workshops on bioinformatics, data science, and software engineering
    - consult individual graduate students or postdocs


# Background

I am an evolutionary biologist at heart, interested in using data science to understand biology across the tree of life. I have published work on plants (*e.g. Arabidopsis arenosa*, *Sapria himalayana*), bacteria (*e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae*), and mammals (*e.g. Loxodonta africana*), and I am currently working with human cancer data. My areas of expertise include population/statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data science, and software engineering.

I did my PhD in plant evolutionary gentics under [Kirsten Bomblies](https://impb.ethz.ch/research/research-evo.html), and we used genomic data to understand how newly formed polyploids (which possess multiple copies of maternal and paternal genomes) arise, evolve, and colonize new habitats.

For my postdoc, I worked under [Bill Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/william-hanage/), [Marc Lipstich](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/marc-lipsitch/), and [Yonatan Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/), studying how bacterial pathogens adapt to new environmental pressures and how this process of adaptation may leave unique, detectable signatures in bacterial genomes.

Since then, I have gained broader interests in data science and computational biology, working as a senior staff scientist on diverse projects in which I analyze data to gain new insights or enhance a group's existing software.
