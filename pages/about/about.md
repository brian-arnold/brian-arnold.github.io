As part of Princeton University's [DataX](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/02/27/datax-effort-jumpstarts-demonstration-data-science-project-princeton) initiative, I am a biomedical data scientist in the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. I work with [Ben Raphael](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/) on topics in cancer genomics. 


# CV

See [here](/about/cv/) for my full CV.

# Career

I enjoy working as a senior scientist in academia and collaborating with faculty and students. My exact role depends on funding sources but generally includes:

- **Scientific research**
    - lead or collaborate on projects
    - help professors acquire grants
    - pursue projects that may not result in publication 
        - high risk but high reward
        - build computational workflows that accelerate/enable other projects
- **Service**
    - teach workshops on bioinformatics or data science
    - consult individual graduate students or postdocs
