As part of Princeton University's [DataX](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/02/27/datax-effort-jumpstarts-demonstration-data-science-project-princeton) initiative, I am a biomedical data scientist in the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning. I work in the department of Computer Science with [Ben Raphael](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/) on topics in cancer genomics, and I teach workshops on data science and software engineering.


# Career

I am a senior research scientist in academia. My exact role depends on funding sources and the community I work with but generally includes:

- **Collaborative research**
    - with computer scientists
        - run existing software on large datasets to identify issues and implement improvements
        - help build new software for data science
    - with biologists
        - take a lead role in analyzing data and publishing results
        - help students run existing software or develop custom analyses
        - construct automated workflows for reproducible results with large datasets
- **Building Infrastructure**
    - develop scalable computational workflows to accelerate research
    - adapt analyses to run in the cloud (GCP, AWS) 
- **Service**
    - teach workshops on bioinformatics, data science, and software engineering
    - consult individual graduate students or postdocs


# Background

I am an evolutionary biologist at heart, interested in using data science to understand biology across the tree of life. I have published work on plants (*e.g. Arabidopsis arenosa*, *Sapria himalayana*), bacteria (*e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae*), and mammals (*e.g. Loxodonta africana*), and I am currently working with human cancer data. My areas of expertise include population/statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data science, and software engineering.

I did my PhD in plant evolutionary gentics under [Kirsten Bomblies](https://impb.ethz.ch/research/research-evo.html), and we used genomic data to understand how newly formed polyploids (which possess multiple copies of maternal and paternal genomes) arise, evolve, and colonize new habitats.

For my postdoc, I worked under [Bill Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/william-hanage/), [Marc Lipstich](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/marc-lipsitch/), and [Yonatan Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/), studying how bacterial pathogens adapt to new environmental pressures and how this process of adaptation may leave unique, detectable signatures in bacterial genomes.

Since then, I have gained broader interests in data science and computational biology, working as a senior staff scientist on diverse projects in which I analyze data to gain new insights or enhance a group's existing software.
